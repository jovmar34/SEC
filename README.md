## Requirements
In order to build and run this project you will need:
* Apache-Maven Version 3
* Java Development Kit 8

## Compiling
In order to compile the whole project execute the following command on **/announcementServer**:

    mvn clean install
    
**Note:** append -DskipTests to the above command to skip all tests 

## Running
In order to run the system..
    
Regarding the server, execute:

    cd announcementServer-ws
    mvn exec:java -Dws.i=y -Dw.f=x
    
Regarding the clients, execute:

    cd announcementServer-ws-cli
    mvn exec:java -Dws.f=x
    
**Note1:** In -Dws.f=x, x is the number of faults to tolerate (e.g: 1, max: 4)

**Note2:** In -Dws.i=y, y is the serverId (e.g: 1, max:16)

## Testing Criptographic Mechanisms
In order to test our criptographic mechanisms, we made some JUnit tests.
Those tests are present in file **CryptoTest.java**, that can be found in folder **/test** under the server module.

## Testing Bizantine Servers
In order to test the dependability requirements for bizantine servers, the process is:

1st step - start up 4 servers (use -Dws.i with range [1,4] and -Dws.f=1)

2nd step - start 1 client (-Dws.f=1)

3rd step - perform some operation to make sure the system is working

4th step - make 1 of the servers crash silently by closing that server's window

5th step - try to perform some operation while that server is down

**Note:** This specific tests allows for 1 byzantine fault
